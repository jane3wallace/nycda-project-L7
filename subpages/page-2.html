					The three R's - reduce, reuse and recycle - all help to cut down on the amount of waste we throw away. They conserve natural resources, landfill space and energy. Plus, the three R's save land and money that communities must use to dispose of waste in landfills.

					How Do I "Reuse"?
				</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>
						Buy, donate and share used things.
					</h3>
					<p>
						Thinking of things as disposable is a very modern attitude. Industrialization has made us capable of creating many things quickly and cheaply, but it has also made us cavalier about the expected life span of these items.
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Buy used. You can find everything from clothes to building materials at specialized reuse centers and consignment shops. Often, used items are less expensive and just as good as new.</li>
						<li>Buy things that are well made and well built so that they will last longer. It may cost a bit more initially for quality, but you will keep these items so much longer that you will get your money's worth in the long run.</li>
						<li>Maintain and repair products, like clothing, tires, and appliances, so that they won't have to be thrown out and replaced as frequently.</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.freecycle.org/" target="_blank">Freecycle</a>. If you have something that you no longer need, offer it in your community freecycle network for free. Conversely, you can get free items for yourself using the same network.</li>
						<li>Donate. Not only will you be reducing waste, you'll be helping others. Local churches, community centers, thrift stores, schools, and nonprofit organizations may accept a variety of donated items, including used books, working electronics, clothes and unneeded furniture.</li>
