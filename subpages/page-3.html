					The three R's - reduce, reuse and recycle - all help to cut down on the amount of waste we throw away. They conserve natural resources, landfill space and energy. Plus, the three R's save land and money that communities must use to dispose of waste in landfills.

						Recycle everything that you can.
					</h3>
					<p>
						As a nation, Americans generate more waste than any other nation in the world with 4.6 pounds (2.04 kg) of municipal solid waste (MSW) per person per day, fifty five percent of which is contributed as residential garbage. The remaining forty five percent of waste in the U.S.'s â€˜waste stream' comes from manufacturing, retailing, and commercial trade in the U.S. economy. Recycling items keeps them from being added to our landfills and also reduces amounts of raw materials harvested from our world. 
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use curbside recycling if your community offers it, or find a <a href="http://www.recyclerfinder.com/" target="_blank">local recycling center</a>.</li>
						<li>Recycle your <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/recycle/electronics-donation-and-recycling" target="_blank">electronics</a>. Electronic waste has become an ever-growing problem in the United States. Each year, over 3.2 million tons of electronic waste is put in US landfills. Although there is an enormous amount of electronic waste in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency found that in 2009 approximately only about 25% of all electronic waste is recycled in the United States.</li>
						<li>Recycle your <a href="http://www.earth911.com/recycling-guide/how-to-recycle-clothing-accessories/" target="_blank">clothes</a>. You may not know that used clothing can even be recycled, but clothing and textiles are nearly 100 percent recyclable.</li>
						<li>Recycle <a href="http://www.partselect.com/JustForFun/Guide-to-Recycling-Appliances-and-Electronics.aspx" target="_blank">old appliances</a> like refriferators. If the item is still working, consider donating it to local charities such as the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, or local battered women's shelters. Many appliances that no longer work can still be used for scrap metal.</li>
