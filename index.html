					The three R's - reduce, reuse and recycle - all help to cut down on the amount of waste we throw away. They conserve natural resources, landfill space and energy. Plus, the three R's save land and money that communities must use to dispose of waste in landfills.

					How Do I "Reduce"?
				</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>
						Choose reusable over disposable items.
					</h3>
					<p>
						Look for areas in your life where the items that you use can be reused. Believe it or not, these little things can really add up. Here are some examples to get you thinking. 
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Bring your own silverware and cup to work for lunch, rather than using disposable utencils and cups.</li>
						<li>Buy reusable items over disposable ones. Reusable coffee filters, k-cups/pods, coffee cups and coffee sleeves can really cut down on daily waste.</li>
						<li>Use linen napkins and cloth towels over paper products. When you do use paper, such as paper towels, buy renewable products made from bamboo or products made from recycled paper.</li>
						<li>Use cloth grocery bags rather than paper or plastic bags.</li>
						<li>Borrow, rent, or share items that are used infrequently, like party decorations, tools, or furniture.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>
						Use less packaging.
					</h3>
					<p>
						This is another area that most people don't consider, but can make a big impact. 
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Buy products that use less packaging. These products are usually labeled as "reduced packaging" or "frustration-free packaging." When manufacturers make their products with less packaging, they use less raw material. This reduces waste and costs and as a bonus, these extra savings are often passed along to the consumer.</li>
						<li>Buy in bulk. This reduces packaging and is usually cheaper.</li>
						<li>Don't buy individually packaged or "snack-sized" products. Buy larger items and portion them with food containers from home.</li>
						<li>Buy fresh fruits and vegetables instead of produce in cans, frozen boxes and bags. Even better, buy from a local farmer's market not only to support local farmers and for fresher produce, but also to reduce shipping waste and transport fuel.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>
						Reduce your carbon footprint.
					</h3>
					<p>
						Reducing your energy consumption helps everyone. Saving 1 kilowatt of electricty is equivalent to keeping 0.741 lb of coal from being burned, which reduces greenhouse gases.
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use renewable energy to power your home. You can install <a href"http://www.solar-states.com/" target="_blank">solar panels</a> or sign up for your <a href="https://ethicalelectric.com/" target="_blank">electrical supplier</a> to use 100% wind energy.</li>
						<li>Replace old appliances (like your HVAC system) with <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/" target="_blank">Energy Star</a> rated appliances. Not only will you save energy, but you will also save money!</li>
						<li>Paint your roof white. White roofs keep buildings cool and reduce energy use. Americans spend about $40 billion annually to air condition buildings - one-sixth of all electricity generated in this country!</li>
						<li>Instead of driving, bike or walk whenever you can. Save gasoline and car expenses and get some fresh air and healthy exercise.</li>
					</ul>
