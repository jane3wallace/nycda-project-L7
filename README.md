# NYCDA WD Lesson 7: <i>Causes Site</i>
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 4 Lecture 2. This project was to build a 3 page website persuading users to help a cause.

### Assignment:
Choose a cause that you really care about and put together a small informational website using HTML/CSS trying to convince people to donate to or help out this cause.

Site Requirements:

* At least a basic sketch before you start coding

* At least 3 pages

* An easy way to e-mail the cause with any inquiries

* A few images

* Uses a few different CSS layouts
